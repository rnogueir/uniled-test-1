# UniLED Technical Test 1

This is the implementation of a contact form developed with PHP. No framework has been used - neither in the front nor in the back end, including unit tests.



## Structure

For the sake of simplicity, a popular LAMP stack has been chosen.

The Form class is responsible for validating the input data, saving it into the database and calling an e-mail service.



## Installation

- clone repository into the staging/production server
- add PDO extension to PHP (if applicable)
- run "composer install"
- load the initial database dump into the MySQL installation of choice
- add MySQL configuration (host, database, username/password)
- add SMTP configuration for the e-mail (server/port, username/password)


## Unit Test

- run with command:	$ php test/TestApp.php


# Test 2

# Test 3

1. Create 3 indexes on <name>, <maker> and <sold_date>
2. Reference: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-limits.html
   Considering a database with a 4KB InnoDB page size, the maximum tablespace size is 16TB. Having a properly dimensioned server, at the given growth rate, the installation is able to run for around 5-7 years without reaching the size limit.
   One possible solution is to use partitioning based on the <sold_date> column. The table can be constantly maintained by archiving and removing the oldest partitions.
